# Graph and Map Visualization for London GeoJson Dataset using D3

## Introduction
This Project provides a comprehensive and interactive way to visualize the London GeoJson dataset using D3 (Data-Driven Documents). It consists of a dashboard containing three visualizations:
1. Map Visualization
2. Graph Visualization
3. Timeline Visualization

## Tools and Technologies
The solution is implemented using the following tools and technologies:
- JavaScript
- D3 (Data-Driven Documents)

## Map Visualization
The map visualization represents the geo-spatial data in the London GeoJson dataset using D3's geographic projections. The map allows for the display of markers, colors, and shapes to represent the data in a meaningful way. It also supports panning and zooming for a more detailed view of the data.

## Graph Visualization
The graph visualization represents the geo-spatial data in the London GeoJson dataset in a graph format. The visualization supports panning, zooming, and selection. It also implements semantic zooming, allowing the user to zoom in on specific parts of the graph for a more detailed view.

## Timeline Visualization
The timeline visualization represents the temporal data in the London GeoJson dataset. It displays the data over time, allowing the user to see patterns and trends in the data. The visualization supports panning, zooming, and selection, and is linked to the other visualizations in the dashboard through brushing and linking.

## Bonus Feature: Focus+Context Technique
In one of the visualizations, the solution incorporates the Focus+Context technique, such as Fish Eye or Cartesian distortion, to showcase advanced interactivity. This technique allows the user to focus on specific parts of the data while still maintaining context of the overall data.

## Conclusion
This Graph and Map Visualization Solution provides a comprehensive and interactive way to visualize the London GeoJson dataset using D3. The use of D3 allows for the creation of high-quality visualizations that are fully interactive and support advanced features such as panning, zooming, selection, brushing, and linking. The solution is highly customizable, allowing the user to change the visualizations to fit their specific needs.
